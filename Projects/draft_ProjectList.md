# Project List

This list contains only **suggested** datasets and tasks. You can use a custom dataset (for safety, check with me first). The only requirement is that it is interesting.

  - **Notes**:
  
    - data file have extension *.npz, can be unzipped like a normal zip archive
    
    - inside there are multiple arrays saved as *.npy files. 
      These are originally Python files, but they can be read in Matlab with the functions from here: https://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab
    
    - if you have problems, contact me, I can convert them for you
    
    - most images are resized to 28x28 from larger images. If you get the original images, you can use CNN networks instead.
