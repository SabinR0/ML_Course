# Projects

For the last weeks of the semester, you will have to implement a mini-project.

The topic of the project is: **do a classification or regression task on a dataset, using one of the usual machine learning algorithms"**

Examples:

 - image classification with CNN networks
 - classification or prediction on other data, using MLP networks or logistic regression
 - prediction with linear regression 
 - any other idea, with any other algorithm you may know or want to use

I will provide you with datasets, or you can use your own,

The coding part can be done in Matlab or other languages you may know (e.g. Python).

The project should be finalized with a written report (a few pages), which should discuss:

  - the dataset used (what it is, specific details, image examples, anything of interest)
  - what is desired
  - the algorithm used, and how you used it
  - results: classification results, training results (if relevant), any other graphical or numerical result relevant for the problem

The projects must be presented in the last week or sometime during the exam session, before the exam.
